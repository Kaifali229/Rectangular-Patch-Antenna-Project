Duration: Jun 2022
Tools: Ansys HFSS, VNA (Vector Network Analyzer)
Description:
Designed and simulated a rectangular microstrip patch antenna for 3.05 GHz using Ansys HFSS. The antenna achieved effective impedance matching at the target frequency and was fabricated using FR4 Epoxy substrate. Post-fabrication, the antennaâ€™s performance was verified with a VNA, confirming return loss and resonance frequency results aligned with simulations'
